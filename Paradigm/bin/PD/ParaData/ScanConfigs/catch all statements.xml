  <Name>catch all statements</Name>
  <Type>CAT II</Type>
  <Risk>Moderate</Risk>
  <Description>catch blocks that use a catch all syntax are typically associated with empty actions.  This type of error handling can lead to vulnerabilites due allowing the program to continue executing in a unknown erroneous state, hence the "catch all".  Software is exploited by forcing the program to execute in a state not intended.  Additionally, catch all statements indicate bad error handling architecture and should be refactored to ensure the program handles errors such that it fails to a secure state.</Description>
